<p><strong>Louis Andriessen</strong> was born in Utrecht in 1939 into a musical family: his father Hendrik, and his brother Jurriaan were established composers in their own right. Andriessen studied with his father and Kees van Baaren at the Hague Conservatory, and between 1962 and 1964 undertook further studies in Milan and Berlin with Luciano Berio. Since 1974 he has combined teaching with his work as a composer and pianist. He is now widely regarded as the leading composer working in the Netherlands today and is a central figure in the international new music scene.</p>

<p>From a background of jazz and avant-garde composition, Andriessen has evolved a style employing elemental harmonic, melodic and rhythmic materials, heard in totally distinctive instrumentation. His acknowledged admiration for Stravinsky is illustrated by a parallel vigour, clarity of expression, and acute ear for colour. The range of Andriessen’s inspiration is wide, from the music of Charles Ives in <em>Anachronie I</em>, the art of Mondriaan in <em>De Stijl</em>, and medieval poetic visions in <em>Hadewijch</em>, to writings on shipbuilding and atomic theory in <em>De Materie Part I</em>. He has tackled complex creative issues, exploring the relation between music and politics in <em>De Staat</em>, the nature of time and velocity in <em>De Tijd</em> and <em>De Snelheid</em>, and questions of mortality in <em>Trilogy of the Last Day</em>.</p>

<p>Andriessen’s compositions have attracted many leading exponents of contemporary music, including the two Dutch groups named after his works De Volharding and Hoketus. Other eminent Dutch performers include Asko Schoenberg, Nieuw Amsterdams Peil, the Schoenberg Quartet, pianists Gerard Bouwhuis and Cees van Zeeland, and conductors Reinbert de Leeuw and Lucas Vis. Groups outside the Netherlands who have commissioned or performed his works include the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Kronos Quartet, London Sinfonietta, Ensemble Modern, MusikFabrik, Icebreaker and the Bang on a Can All Stars.</p>

<p>Collaborative works with other artists include a series of dance projects, the full length theatre piece <em>De Materie</em> created with Robert Wilson for the Netherlands Opera, and three works created with Peter Greenaway: the film <em>M is for Man, Music, Mozart</em>, and the stage works <em>ROSA Death of a Composer</em> and <em>Writing to Vermeer</em>, premiered at the Netherlands Opera in 1994 and 1999 respectively. Collaborations with film maker Hal Hartley have included <em>The New Math(s)</em> in 2000 and <em>La Commedia</em>, an operatic setting of Dante for Netherlands Opera premiered at the Holland Festival in 2008. Nonesuch Records has released a series of recordings of Andriessen’s major works, including the complete <em>De Materie</em>, <em>ROSA Death of a Composer</em> and <em>Writing to Vermeer</em>.</p>

<p>Commissions since 2010 include the music theatre piece <em>Anaïs Nin</em> for singer Cristina Zavalloni and 8 musicians and <em>La Girò</em> for violinist Monica Germino and large ensemble premiered at MITO SettembreMusica in 2011. The 2013/14 season brought premieres of <em>Mysteriën</em> by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Mariss Jansons and <em>Tapdance</em> for percussion and large ensemble with Colin Currie in the ZaterdagMatinee series in Amsterdam. His new opera <em>Theatre of the World</em> received first performances in Los Angeles and Amsterdam in 2016.</p>

<p>Louis Andriessen held the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer’s Chair at Carnegie Hall, New York, and was awarded Composer of the Year Award by Musical America in 2010. He won the 2011 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for his opera La Commedia, which was released on CD and DVD by Nonesuch in 2014.</p>
