<p><strong>Aaron Spotts</strong> (b.1980) is a composer originally from Washington state, studying with Dr. Roger Briggs, and receiving his bachelors degree from Western Washington University in 2008. He earned his masters degree in composition from Florida State University (FSU) in 2015, where he is currently continuing study with Dr. Ladislav Kubik as a doctoral student. His recent activities have included: holding the Zwilich graduate assistantship in ’15-’16, which focused on orchestral studies under Dr. Alex Jimenez in conjunction with the FSU orchestras; the premier of his <em>Two Days’ Bar Talk</em> at the 2016 SCI Region VI conference; and having his string quartet chosen as a finalist for the 2016 Bruno Maderna Composition Competition, taking place the last week of July in Lviv, Ukraine.

<p><strong><em>Two Days’ Bar Talk</em></strong>, written for a Duo Rodinia commission in 2014, is inspired by personal compositional material I accumulated over a number of years. When envisioning the piece in the early stages of the writing process, I had an epiphany that these unused and separately conceived ideas had a common character somewhat reminiscent of Bartók. I subsequently employed them in pursuit of this connection, composing them out and tying them together with music that altogether framed a rhythmically driven and dynamic musical form that somewhat imitates the folk music that influenced Bartók. Thus, the title, whose surface meaning may allude to the boisterous atmosphere of a bar for “two days” (outer sections, which are separated by a slower “late night” section), also has a second, more apt meaning: today’s Bartók.</p>
