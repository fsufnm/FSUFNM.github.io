<strong><em>Peppercorn Suite</em></strong>: <em>Movement 1: Black</em> for soprano and alto saxophones. The most common type of peppercorn, these are cooked green peppercorns that are then dried. They have the strongest flavor of the peppercorns. <em>Movement 2: Pink</em> for two soprano saxophones. Not actually peppercorns at all, but rather berries from a South American shrub. Most often used for garnishing, they have a delicate, floral taste. <em>Movement 3: Green</em> for alto and tenor saxophones. These are underripe black peppercorns that are often pickled. They have a fruity, slightly tart flavor. <em>Movement 4: White</em> for baritone and tenor saxophones. White peppercorns are simply black peppercorns that have been soaked and had the skins removed. The taste is less pungent, but more intense than black peppercorns.</p>
