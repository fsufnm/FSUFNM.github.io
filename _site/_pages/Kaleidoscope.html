      <td><strong><em>Kaleidoscope</em></strong> refers to the structural idea of small colorful shapes that are combined and recombined into symmetrical patterns (kalos, beautiful; eidos, shapes; skopein, to examine). The piece is in three large sections, and each section employs one of the three different octatonic scales (symmetrical scales alternating half and whole steps). The title also refers to the wonderfully varied colors of the wind symphony. As a personal tribute to Karel Husa, I have quoted a phrase from the Hussite hymn ìYe Warriors of God,î which is so prominent in both Smetanaís M· vlast and Husaís Music for Prague 1968. My piece ends with a quiet codaóa tribute to the sincerity and integrity exhibited by Karel Husa throughout his distinguished life in music.</td>
