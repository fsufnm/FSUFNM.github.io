<p><strong><em>Cineshape 4</em></strong> borrows structural elements from the German film “Run Lola Run.” This film is divided into three episodes; Lola repeats the same day three times, starting in exactly the same way, but each time hoping that a slight modification of her actions will save the life of her boyfriend. This simple concept—that there are numerous ways to develop a particular idea and that minor choices have serious consequences—leads to a multifaceted structure. Much like the film, the piece is a high-paced, energetic tour-de-force, literally running from start to finish with only occasional moments to stop and take a breath.</p>
