<p>“…the only truly significant and meaningful work for solo brass quintet and wind ensemble composed to date. <strong><em>What We Do Is Secret</em></strong> is sophisticated, gripping, abstract yet engaging, sometimes hauntingly beautiful, and filled with virtuosity. This is American music at its best - imaginative, challenging, powerful, and direct.” ― Eric Hewitt, Director, Boston Conservatory Wind Ensemble. “[<em>What We Do Is Secret</em>] is a very intriguing and unique work, both in terms of inspiration and execution. Thanks so much for avoiding the clichés and formulas we hear in so much band/wind ensemble writing these days….very original and highly imaginative!” ― Col. Michael J. Colburn, Director, United States Marine Band. <em>What We Do Is Secret</em> is a concerto for brass quintet &amp; wind ensemble, commissioned by the Barlow Endowment for Triton Brass &amp; a consortium of wind ensembles. The work has won four national and international awards, and is released on <em>The Unheard Music</em> CD (Albany Records, 2013).</p>
