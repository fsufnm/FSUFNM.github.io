<p><strong><em>I Can’t Breathe</em></strong> was commissioned by the Musikfabrik Ensemble and supported by the Ministry of Families, Children, Youth, Culture and Sports, Province of Rhineland-Westphalia.</p>

<p>I live in the USA. I like it here. It is a wonderful country with wonderful people and wonderful culture.</p>

<p>But …</p>

<p>When I walk on a lonely street in New York in the evening, I am afraid. Of criminals. If my skin were black, I would be more afraid of the police than I am of criminals.</p>

<p>Eric Garner has become a symbol.</p>

<p>He had doubly bad luck. On the one hand, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But above all, his skin was the wrong colour. His offence: he had bought cigarettes. And he was African-American. The police thought he was a black marketeer and acted accordingly. During this official action he suffocated – he was asthmatic. His last words were “I can’t breathe!”</p>

<p>Those who brought about his death were not even indicted – they did not have to stand trial in any court.</p>

<p>That was not just one isolated case.</p>

<p>Protest stirred. “Black Lives Matter!” was the slogan heard throughout the land at much-noted demonstrations. I declare my solidarity with that protest in this work.</p>

<p><em>I can’t breathe</em> for solo trumpet in memoriam Eric Garner begins quite traditionally with a dirge: a free cantilena in twelve-tone space. Then the intervals constrict; the song becomes more and more smothered, ultimately in a 16-note scale. The dirge constricts within a sonic space of other trumpet notes of extreme registers and changing colours – cautionary symbols, perhaps, of the world from which the victim was violently torn away.</p>

<p>I give no notes to the perpetrators.</p>
