<p>Moving to a foreign country forced me to deal with the idea that I am “the other”: I’m a non-citizen, an alien, “the international student”, “the Brazilian girl”, “the female composer from Brazil”. It was strange to see my whole identity become so intensely bound to the country in which I was born and my gender. Some thoughts about being uprooted, culturally inadequate, socially dis-empowered and artistically overlooked set the tone of <strong><em>Otherness</em></strong>. In this piece I worked with materials that were radically different from each other and tried to manipulate them to find points of similarities, either via physical gesture, timbre, melodic shape and/or rhythmic patterns. The idea of being in someone else’s shoes -as a way of understanding different perspectives and then being able to incorporate and/or transform these perspectives - colored the way I treated the instruments in this piece, as well as some decisions about form.</p>
