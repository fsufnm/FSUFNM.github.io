<p>The poetry of the Japanese <em>haiku</em>, a tradition that has existed for more than three hundred years, has inspired me for a long time. When I decided to compose my first haiku, the focus of my creativity was exploring the many compositional possibilities hidden within the miniature form. However, it was soon revealed to me the depth at which this specific genre of Japanese poetry reflects the coalescensce of life, death, and our fundamental connection with nature. Thus, the concept of <strong><em>14 Haiku</em></strong> emerged. Recently, I have extended this cycle to twenty four parts. <em>24 Haiku</em> was published by Triga and recorded for the NEOS label. It is dedicated to its first performers, mezzo-soprano Phyllis Pancella and pianist Hui-Ting Yang.</p>
