<p><strong>Daniel J. Thompson</strong> is a composer and improviser primarily fixated on electroacoustic and algorithmic music. His chamber works have been performed in New York City and Tokyo, and in 2014, his piano etude <em>electronumbcomfy</em> was selected as a finalist in the BMI Student Composer Awards. In addition to creative endeavors, Daniel is also active in music scholarship, with a primary focus on semiotic approaches to meaning in East-Coast jazz of the 1950s and 60s. He has presented this work at several music theory conferences–including the national meeting of the Society for Music Theory (SMT). Currently residing in Tallahassee, FL, Daniel is pursuing a PhD in music theory–where he has also served as a graduate teaching assistantship in both the areas of music theory and jazz studies.</p>

<p><strong><em>remnants</em></strong> is a work for clarinet and computer that plays on the notion of indexicality (C.S. Peirce)—in which a signifier is produced by that which it signifies. For instance, a hangover might index a night of celebration (or despair), just as the smell of smoke might index a cigarette. In <em>remnants</em>, this effect is achieved musically by the processing of the lyrical clarinet material by the computer (using patches coded in SuperCollider)—resulting in a texture whose source is audibly a clarinet, but only a trace of it. This work is ultimately a contemplation of the union between meaningful events in our lives and the souvenirs that index them, as well as the transience of human consciousness. How meaningful are our memories if our brains constantly change, reshape, and distort the recollection of experiences that make us who we are? If you prefer not to ponder such infinite subjectivity and chaos, just follow the ABCB form of the movement for syntactic comfort. ; )</p>
