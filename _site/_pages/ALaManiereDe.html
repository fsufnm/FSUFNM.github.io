<p>I composed the first of these preludes on a lark after studying numerous passages of Chopin consisting of staggered chromatic lines descending in all voices. Unsure what to do with such a brief, seemingly backward-looking piece, it remained dormant. A few years later, having written the second prelude on somewhat less of a lark, the set of six tributes to musical forebears began to take shape. In each prelude some aspect of a composer’s style, technique, or even specific fragments form the basis for my own take. The preludes were not intended to be stylistic exercises or parodies, but rather opportunities to explore without inhibition elements (latently) present in my own voice. The title itself, <strong><em>a la manière de …</em></strong>, is a reference to Ravel’s own works synthesizing his voice with the styles of Borodin and Chabrier/Gounod.</p>
