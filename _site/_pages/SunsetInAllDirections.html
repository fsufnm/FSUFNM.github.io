      <td><strong>Stephen Andrew Taylor</strong> (1965-) composes music that explores boundaries between art and science. His first orchestra commission, Unapproachable Light, inspired by images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the New Testament, was premiered by the American Composers Orchestra in 1996 in Carnegie Hall. Other works include the quartet Quark Shadows, commissioned by the Chicago Symphony; Paradises Lost, an opera based on a novella by Ursula K. Le Guin, received its Canadian premiere in 2013, conducted by the composer. Besides traditional instruments, Taylor also works with technology in pieces such as Ocean of Air (2017) for Detroit Symphony principal trombonist Kenneth Thompkins, and Indian Hedgehog for saxophone and electronics, premiered by Debra Richtmeyer in Strasbourg in 2015. He grew up in Illinois and studied at Northwestern and Cornell Universities, and the California Institute of the Arts. A 2014-15 Fellow of the Guggenheim Foundation, he teaches at the University of Illinois.</td>

      <td>In August 2017 our family saw the total eclipse. It was like nothing in the world Iíve ever seen, and weíre making plans for the next one on April 8, 2024. The moments just before totality, in the words of a friend, look like <strong><em>sunset in all directions</em></strong>. I was loosely thinking of the cello solo as the Moon; the low, brooding instruments as the Earth; and the highest, brightest instruments as the Sun. After introducing all three, the main part of the piece begins with a fast, spinning motive in the cello. The form of the piece consists of three celestial events: two partial eclipses, which I think of as ìnear misses,î and finally, the total eclipse. Twice, cross-rhythms in the two percussionists grow closer together, only to just miss each other. Then on the third attempt, after a cello cadenza, the percussive cross-rhythms once again grow closer, and finally join together as the strings all reach the same note, spread across eight octaves.</td>
