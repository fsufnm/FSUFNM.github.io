<p><strong><em>Garden of Eros</em></strong> (Tuin van Eros) is based upon an idea which is unusual, if not completely wrong for a string quartet: a piece for solo violin, accompanied by three string instruments.</p>

<p>While composing it, I realised that this idea was not far away from the roots of the string quartet: Haydn’s early quartets. However, the piece does not sound like Haydn.</p>

<p>The title comes from a long and beautiful love poem in 50 quatrains written by Jan Engelman in 1934. I follow the sentiment of the poem somewhat loosely in the music, but the structure of the poem quite rigidly: the piece contains as many beats as the poem contains syllables.</p>

<p>The work lasts 12 minutes and is written for Arditti Quartet, to the memory of my brother Jurriaan, the composer.</p>
