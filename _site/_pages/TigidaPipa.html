<p><em><strong>Tigida Pipa</strong></em> was commissioned by Elms Concerts London, composed in Ghent, Belgium and completed in London January, 1983. The text consists of invented words (inspired by the text compositions of Frank Denyer) which provide an array of percussive sounds whose inherent rhythmic structures propel the work at breakneck speed through a rondo of sonic colors. London’s Financial Times described it as: “…a tongue twisting, tempo-twisting vocal toccata brilliantly sustained,” and Opera magazine as: “a virtuoso ritual for percussionists-cum-vocalists, ebullient and inventive far beyond the Steve Reich school of minimalism.” The work was commissioned for the professional London based vocal ensemble, <em>Singcircle</em> (Director Gregory Rose) as a virtuoso <em>tour de force</em>.</p>

<p>The original tape part was realized at the IPEM/Belgian Radio Studios, Ghent in 1982-83 and revised later in the composer’s London studio, 1989. The premiere was Rosslyn Hill Chapel (Hampstead), London 19 February, 1983. A recording is available on the Continuum label (NZ) 1061 on a CD of Montague’s works entitled: <em>Stephen Montague – Orchestral and Chamber Music</em> released in 1994.</p>
