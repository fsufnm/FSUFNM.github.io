<p>American composers have long been fascinated by nature; the canon is filled with works that invoke the awe-inspiring majesty of the country’s landscape. In <strong><em>Five Pieces for String Quartet</em></strong>, however, I am interested in nature on a microbiological scale. I am thinking not about mountains, but microbes. In this spirit, the work explores the quirks of small-scale musical and physical form—the longest movement (“Organism”) is just over four minutes long; the shortest (“Breath”) is forty seconds. The piece can be performed in its full electroacoustic form or as a solely acoustic piece; in the case of the the latter, the second and fourth movements are omitted.</p>
