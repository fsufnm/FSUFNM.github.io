<p><strong><em>Rhythmensional</em></strong> showcases drummer Dafnis Prieto (2011 MacArthur Fellow), whose solo improvisation (created specifically for this project) serves as the foundation for a live ensemble that is superposed with the drums. The live players follow a score and perform alongside Dafnis’s pre-recorded solo, creating a superposition of past and present musical events. At the outset of the piece, Dafnis’s playing sparks new ideas that spread through the ensemble; this is followed by a playful and often fiery dialogue between both parties.</p>
