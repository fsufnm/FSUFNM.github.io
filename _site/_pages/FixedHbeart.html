<strong><em>F I X E D HbeaRt</em></strong>: I never understood exactly what we are all trying to get to. The ascending lines of HbeaRt are my searching attempts for getting to a solid point. There are several random elements built into the live electronics that resemble the unexpected events of everyday life; yet, we continue to ascend. In the second movement however, I explore the emmotional components of being F I X E D and stuck in a situation, a terminal disease, war, etc. Even in such predicaments, the music begs for action and movement, inspired by the innate nature of life.</p>
