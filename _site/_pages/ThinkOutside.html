I record all the sounds I use in my studio and in the field. I only use ìM/Sî stereo mic techniques because I can more easily manipulate the resulting ìthree tracksî. I listen to my environment and record it. Then compose with dynamics, space, timbre, unfamiliarity, fun! Edited, mixed and combined - I find myself. <strong><em>Think Outside</em></strong> was made with recordings from January ñ March 2018.</p>
