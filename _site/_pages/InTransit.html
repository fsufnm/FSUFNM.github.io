<p>Written during the summer of 2009, <strong><em>in transit</em></strong> was inspired by Béla Bartók’s ethnomusicological research on the music of various cultures of East Europe and Asia Minor. I was drawn not only to the sheer sonic qualities of the songs themselves, but also by the fact that every song is a story. Melodic material is based on Bartók’s annotations of a Turkish folksong from Asia Minor: “how should I praise such a beauty: she mingled her hair with golden twine.” In a brusque manner, eventually dominating the musical discourse, are quotations of my own setting of a Bosnian folksong, “The Old Mother of Dzhaferbeg.” The text of this second song recounts the lurid tale of a jealous old mother wrongly accusing her beautiful daughter-in-law of an affair, and the resulting murder of the innocent woman by the enraged husband. My setting featured the textures of the “kemence” fiddle accompaniment in addition to the vocal line. The piano mimics the “kemence,” and the (Western) violin wailing voices.</p>
