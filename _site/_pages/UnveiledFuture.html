Wan aims to write music that is sympathetic and delightful, in which an active communication occurs between and amongst the composer, the performers, and the listeners.

      <td><strong><em>Unveiled Future</em></strong> is composed after reading the book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind written by Yuval Noah Harari. While describing important revolutions which made current humankind and the world, the author points out that humans never could predict the exact result of those revolutions. For example, agricultural revolution led to population explosions and forced humans to work harder than when they were foragers, and the invention of home appliances made the world go faster so that people are expected to do more work in the same amount of time. In the last chapter, the author talks about scientific revolution, especially about genetic engineering. He argues that even though no one can predict all possible results of consistent development of genetic engineering, humans will never stop. Through <em>Unveiled Future</em>, I aim to depict our desire towards the better future, that we always hope to be more developed and constantly progress to another significant revolution. In the contrasting part, I tried to express the negative effects, damage, and questions on the other side. The parts are alternated, but each part is modified as the piece gets to the end and finally, both parts are combined as one part. The overall structure of the piece reflects my personal question around the consistent development, hoping to become a part of desirable and peaceful world.</td>
