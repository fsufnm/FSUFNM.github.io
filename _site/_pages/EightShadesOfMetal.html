<p>I was intrigued by the idea of writing for this instrumental combination, because I find areas of similarity and contrast between the sax &amp; trombone quartets. Both the trombones and saxophones are made of brass and exude a certain powerful timbre. That trombones should produce this power is perhaps not surprising. However, one does not tend to think of woodwind instruments as “powerful.” The saxophone family is the exception to this rule. This may well be due to the origins of the saxophone. The instrument can trace its development back to the ophicleide, a keyed brass instrument of the 19th century. Despite taking advantage of some timbral similarities, the piece also seeks to highlight the unique differences between the two instrumental families. There is no programmatic element to <strong><em>eight shades of metal</em></strong>. Given my interest in fast, rhythmic music, I sought to create a rollicking good time for the performers. It’s my hope that this translates well and that audiences experience a similar joy.</p>
