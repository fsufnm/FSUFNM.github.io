<strong><em>Triangulation</em></strong> uses three different techniques in the electronics, but the result is that it’s hard to hear what technique is used. The three techniques serve to the same goal- to expand the possibilities of the acoustic piano.</p>

<strong><em>Long It Glows:</em></strong> On Shelter You can write on a wall with a fish heart, it’s because of the phosphorus. They eat it. There are shacks like that down along the river. I am writing this to be as wrong as possible to you. Replace the door when you leave, it says. Now you tell me how wrong that is, how long it glows. Tell me. -Anne Carson, Plainwater</p>

<p><strong>Martin Blessinger</strong> is an Associate Professor of Music at Texas Christian University. He holds a D.M. in music composition from the Florida State University, where he was a University Research Fellow, studying with Ladislav Kubik and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. He received undergraduate and master’s degrees from SUNY at Stony Brook, studying with Sheila Silver and Perry Goldstein. Prior to arriving TCU, he worked as a Lecturer in Music Theory at Ithaca College. His works have been performed around the country and abroad by numerous professional and collegiate ensembles. Further, he has won awards from the Diana Barnhart American Song Competition (for Cradle Song), the Eppes String Quartet Competition (for Postcard from the Americas), the Illinois Wesleyan University Young Composers Competition (for Fanfare for Brass Quintet), the NACUSA Young Composers Competition (for Duo for Saxophone and Piano), and ASCAP. His music is published by Reed Music and C. Alan Publications.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exordium et Infra Furorem</em></strong> (roughly ìIntroduction and In a State of Furyî) is a virtuosic two-movement work for solo violin. The first movement, Exordium, began its life as a flute etude. As my concept of the piece developed, it became clear that the musical material was not appropriate for the etude project, and so I decided to adapt it for solo violin. The title of this movement is Latin for “beginning” or “introductionî to capture the prelude-like atmosphere of the music. The second movement, Infra Furorem, is fast-moving and aggressive, featuring tempestuously shifting emotions. I wrote this movement as a counterbalance to the stoicism and reserved stateliness of the first.</p>

<p>I composed the first of these preludes on a lark after studying numerous passages of Chopin consisting of staggered chromatic lines descending in all voices. Unsure what to do with such a brief, seemingly backward-looking piece, it remained dormant. A few years later, having written the second prelude on somewhat less of a lark, the set of six tributes to musical forebears began to take shape. In each prelude some aspect of a composer’s style, technique, or even specific fragments form the basis for my own take. The preludes were not intended to be stylistic exercises or parodies, but rather opportunities to explore without inhibition elements (latently) present in my own voice. The title itself, <strong><em>a la manière de …</em></strong>, is a reference to Ravel’s own works synthesizing his voice with the styles of Borodin and Chabrier/Gounod.</p>

<p><strong>Ian Evans Guthrie</strong> is emerging as a tour-de-force composer and pianist. He recently won 1st prize in the Arcady Composition Competition, 2nd place in the American Prize-Chamber Music Division (the only 2017 vocal work to receive recognition recognition in this category), and 2nd prize in the Great Composers Competition: Music of America, in addition to his many other prizes and recognitions from ASCAP, SCI, MTNA, NFMC, and other national and regional music organizations and clubs. In addition, many of his works have been performed publicly around the world by the Indaco String Quartet, fEARnoMUSIC, Metropolitan Youth Symphony, Northwest Symphony Orchestra, Moore Philharmonic Orchestra, Erik Drescher, Sarah Dunham, and others, and featured at festivals internationally. Guthrie is a doctoral student at Florida State University, where his teachers include Mark Wingate, Ellen Zwilich, and (formerly) Ladislav Kubik.
I began sketching <strong><em>Lavelatla</em></strong> in early Fall 2017 as ideas for orchestra or two pianos. All I knew about the sketch was that it could appropriate my interests in world music, particularly that of the Caribbean. This project came into fruition well after I approached my colleague Xinshuang Jin about my interest in writing a work for two pianos, when she commissioned me to compose such a work in April 2018. I then took my knowledge of electronic music, world, music, spatialization, acoustics, and orchestration to create an innovative piano duet imitating the many effects available in these fields, such as panning, Shepard tones, unusual staging, spectralism, and other effects that have been relatively unexplored in piano literature. Considering the fiery nature and other associations conceived with the sketches and my interest in Native American names for landmarks, I settled with the title <em>Lavelatla</em> (meaning ìSmoking Mountainî)óthe Cowlitz tribe’s name for Mount Saint Helens.</p>

<p>Shadows are not solely silent and not solely analogue companions. By choosing the projected image out of a plethora of possible aesthetic varieties Georg Friedrich Haas decides on a variant with the pianist foreshadowing them. The electronic means: the played material is recorded live and then repeated—transposed a quarter tone higher—with
an initial delay of 24 seconds to the piano. While the work continues the tempo of the echo playback is increased by the factor 32/33. The sound of the piano itself remains electronically unmodifed. The course of the playback results in most accurately calculated pulsating parallels between the realtime-performance and the playback recording; however due to the time-lapsed playbacks its positions do not allow an exact temporal correspondence. Like the moon penetrating the shadow of the earth, like in a lunar eclipse where the cosmic shadow play reaches a congruent form, here the shadow of the sound follows the performer at increasingly shorter intervals until the permanent diference between the sender of the sound and its transformed echo is set to zero by the end
of the piece. In the delicate sound world of the Austrian composer, in which once again evening and nocturnal atmospheres spin their eerie webs, changes of the tonal and harmonic possibilities of the traditional scale are given a major space through the means of microtonality or experiments with pending overtone constellations. In his “Shadow Play” (<strong><em>Ein Schattenspiel</em></strong>) he quotes the quartertone music of Ivan Wyschnogradsy and his tempered halving of major sevenths, as well as the music of Richard Heinrich Stein, in which tonal chords are connected by means of voicing in quartertone intervals. In his interpretation Haas has been interested especially in historical aspects of the shadow play: “The musician is constantly confronted with what he has just played. The live electronic is confronting him with his very own history. Finally he will be overtaken by this very history.”<br />

<p>I live in the USA. I like it here. It is a wonderful country with wonderful people and wonderful culture.</p>

<p>But …</p>

<p>When I walk on a lonely street in New York in the evening, I am afraid. Of criminals. If my skin were black, I would be more afraid of the police than I am of criminals.</p>

<p>Eric Garner has become a symbol.</p>

<p>He had doubly bad luck. On the one hand, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But above all, his skin was the wrong colour. His offence: he had bought cigarettes. And he was African-American. The police thought he was a black marketeer and acted accordingly. During this official action he suffocated – he was asthmatic. His last words were “I can’t breathe!”</p>

<p>Those who brought about his death were not even indicted – they did not have to stand trial in any court.</p>

<p>That was not just one isolated case.</p>

<p>Protest stirred. “Black Lives Matter!” was the slogan heard throughout the land at much-noted demonstrations. I declare my solidarity with that protest in this work.</p>

<p><em>I can’t breathe</em> for solo trumpet in memoriam Eric Garner begins quite traditionally with a dirge: a free cantilena in twelve-tone space. Then the intervals constrict; the song becomes more and more smothered, ultimately in a 16-note scale. The dirge constricts within a sonic space of other trumpet notes of extreme registers and changing colours – cautionary symbols, perhaps, of the world from which the victim was violently torn away.</p>

<p>I give no notes to the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Born in Seoul, South Korea, <strong>Wan Heo</strong> is pursuing her Masterís at Florida State University with Clifton Callender where she teaches undergraduate Aural Skills as a Teaching Assistant. Wan holds a Bachelorís in Music from Ewha University, South Korea, where she was awarded a scholarship for notable achievements in 2015. During her undergraduate career her string quartet, Three C in Mobile, was selected to be performed at the composition departmentís spring concert in 2014. Wan aims to write music that is sympathetic and delightful, in which an active communication occurs between and amongst the composer, the performers, and the listeners. Starting from a rough plan, Wan composes music as an explorer, focusing on how sounds will make her, and her audience feel. Her works have been performed in Seoul, Singapore, and the United States, by performers including Keuris Quartet (Netherlands), and Eppes Quartet (Florida State University).
<strong><em>Unveiled Future</em></strong> is composed after reading the book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind written by Yuval Noah Harari. While describing important revolutions which made current humankind and the world, the author points out that humans never could predict the exact result of those revolutions. For example, agricultural revolution led to population explosions and forced humans to work harder than when they were foragers, and the invention of home appliances made the world go faster so that people are expected to do more work in the same amount of time. In the last chapter, the author talks about scientific revolution, especially about genetic engineering. He argues that even though no one can predict all possible results of consistent development of genetic engineering, humans will never stop. Through <em>Unveiled Future</em>, I aim to depict our desire towards the better future, that we always hope to be more developed and constantly progress to another significant revolution. In the contrasting part, I tried to express the negative effects, damage, and questions on the other side. The parts are alternated, but each part is modified as the piece gets to the end and finally, both parts are combined as one part. The overall structure of the piece reflects my personal question around the consistent development, hoping to become a part of desirable and peaceful world.</p>

<p><strong>Aaron Houston</strong> Aaron Houston composes music that draws from the diverse influences of the American musical language for the everyday concert audience. His eclectic influencesófrom rock music to folk tunes, chorales, and everything in betweenócan be heard in his use of harmonies and intuitive melodic writing. Taking inspiration from Wagner and Guns Ní Roses, his composition Reconciliation (2017) juxtaposes a variety of these influences against each other before finding resolution in an ever-ascending statement of a Bach chorale. Similarly, Scuttle Buttiní (2018), was inspired by the sounds of Texas Blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan and recalls the sounds of a young guitarist learning to mimic the playing of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Currently, Aaron is pursuing his DM in Composition at Florida State University where he has studied with Stephen Montague, Ellen Taafe Zwilich, and the late Ladislav Kubik as the recipient of the Ellen Taaffe Zwilich Fellowship for orchestral composition.
When asked to compose a piece which responded in some way to folk songs or storytelling, I was immediately excited. Remembering all the times in middle school and high school sitting in front of a TV watching an old VHS tape of live Stevie Ray Vaughan concerts quickly sparked the inspiration for this composition. While learning to play guitar, I would sit and watch that VHS tape and hope I would one day be able to play like the man who helped define what Texas blues was for me (spoiler alert: I canít play guitar like Stevie Ray Vaughan). Scuttle Buttiní is a fast-paced, highly energetic work inspired by the tune from Stevie Ray Vaughan of the same name. A ìscuttle buttî is an old term for a water cooler and ìscuttle buttiníî is an old term for gossiping around the water cooleróhow stories get told a lot in the South. Scuttle Buttiní is full of quotations from blues riffs, harmonies which evoke a jazz-based sound, and aggressively picked and slapped bass to mimic the sounds of a Texas blues band.</p>

<strong><em>Shan Ko</em></strong> employs material derived from Hakka music. There are various types of Hakka mountain songs, with an abundance of lyrical content. The song-type associated with my piece is called Lao-shan-ko (old mountain songs), which are among the oldest and simplest of Hakka folk song-types. Lao-shan-ko is the name of one such tune, which I have referenced. I am particularly drawn by its use of the minor triad and the libre feeling of the original tune. As a result, many minor triads juxtaposing with the predominantly pentatonic harmony are deployed to explore various timbres between different instrumental groups in the piece. Many times, the melodic fragments are stretched and heavily decorated. Sometimes the echoes of those fragments are produced between instruments. It is the spirit of freedom and spacious acoustics in the mountains that I have tried capture.</p>

<strong><em>—amand˙</em></strong> is the creator god of the Guarani people. In their folklore, —amand˙ created himself out of the darkness and then proceeded to create the world. From the beginning, the Hummingbird was present, and sustained and refreshed —amand˙ as he created. “Our Father, the Absolute First created himself from the primordial darkness. He created the divine soles of his feet, His small round throne. He created them as he grew in the primordial darkness. Flowers adorned his divine feathered headdress like drops of dew; And amidst the flowers of his sacred feathered crown Hummingbird, the primeval bird, gamboled and flew. Even while our first Father created his own divine body, He existed in the midst of the primordial winds. Before he conceived his future earthly dwelling, before he conceived his future heavens, his future earth ó Hummingbird refreshed his mouth. It was Hummingbird who sustained —amand˙ with the fruits of paradise.</p>

In <strong><em>Sisyphus in Situ</em></strong>, my second composition realized using wave field synthesis, we donít see Sisyphus, but rather hear him through wobbling sounds selected to depict the step-by-step ascent of the heavy boulder, as it is pushed up the hill. A central synthesis technique in the piece uses sound analysis data to automate the selection of other sounds, chosen so as to reinforce and build upon the resonances and spectral form of the wobbles with which they synchronize. I imagine this process of orchestration as inscriptional, as it uses each driving sound to grow coincident sound events ranging from highlighted resonances, spread across the spaceís background field, to foregrounded gestural extrapolations and the antiphonies they inspire. I like to think that this range of sound somehow parallels Sisyphusí experience, as it repeatedly shifts between the intimacy of his studied task and the dramatic erasure of its completion, once the boulder meets its fall.</p>

<p><strong>Peter Van Zandt Lane</strong> is a composer with a creative focus on concert music (especially for wind ensembles), electroacoustic/interactive music, and music for dance. A recipient of the 2018 Charles Ives Fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, his work has also been recognized by Copland House, Composers Now, the American Prize, and the Lili Boulanger Memorial Prize. He has held residencies at MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, and the Atlantic Center for the Arts. Recently commissioned works include “Piano Quartet: The Longitude Problem” (commissioned by Atlanta Chamber Players); “Radix Tyrannis” (a trombone concerto for Joseph Alessi and American Chamber Winds); “Chamber Symphony” (commissioned by the Barlow Endowment for Equilibrium Ensemble), and “Hivemind” (commissioned by the Sydney Conservatorium Wind Symphony). Peter is Assistant Professor of Composition at the University of Georgia Hugh Hodgson School of Music.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hivemind</em></strong> is a fast-paced, energetic piece for winds and percussion. Thematically, the piece explores the idea of consensus building. Scattered themes and fragments gradually come together into more cohesive units. Melodies emerge from buzzing textures, trying to make sense of conflicting harmonies. The ensemble is grounded by two percussionists, each with economical and identical instrument setups, who constantly bounce rhythms back and forth from the far sides of the stage (until they, also, coalesce into unity). I like to think of the resulting antiphony as a conversation between the left-brain and right-brain–a spacial and musical dialogue that reinforces the dichotomy between what is structured and what is free; what is anticipated and what is surprising; and between what is cerebral and what is emotive. This piece was commissioned by the Sydney Conservatorium Wind Symphony, under the direction of John P. Lynch.</p>

<strong><em>Kaleidoscope</em></strong> refers to the structural idea of small colorful shapes that are combined and recombined into symmetrical patterns (kalos, beautiful; eidos, shapes; skopein, to examine). The piece is in three large sections, and each section employs one of the three different octatonic scales (symmetrical scales alternating half and whole steps). The title also refers to the wonderfully varied colors of the wind symphony. As a personal tribute to Karel Husa, I have quoted a phrase from the Hussite hymn ìYe Warriors of God,î which is so prominent in both Smetanaís M· vlast and Husaís Music for Prague 1968. My piece ends with a quiet codaóa tribute to the sincerity and integrity exhibited by Karel Husa throughout his distinguished life in music.</p>

A four-concert festival of his music was held at Spectrum in New York in September of 2016.
<strong><em>Inner Voices</em></strong> was written for my long time friend Richard Becker, composer, pianist, composer, and poet. We were classmates in our undergraduate years at the Eastman School of Music. Fifty years later, we reconnected at the last New Music Consortium at USF in 2016. Inner Voices is introspective, elegiac, and nuanced–qualities I especially admire in Richard’s playing. This six minute composition is made like a poem with structural rhymes, assonances, and stanzas, starting simply but eventually becoming complex and ramified and sound and sense–like a theme and variations, but with not much distinction between the theme and the variations.</p>

<p>Composer/pianist <strong>Ketty Nez</strong> joined the Boston University in 2005, after teaching for two years at the University of Iowa. Her folk opera, “The Fiddler and the Old Woman of Rumelia,” was premiered in 2011 and staged in 2012, by the Xanthos and Juventas Ensembles, respectively. CD’s include “Listen to a Wonder Never Heard Before!” by Albany Records, and thresholds, by Ravello Records. Her chamber opera “An Opera in Devolution: Drama in 540 Seconds,” was premiered at the 2003 Munich Festival A*Devantgarde. Ketty studied at IRCAM in 1998-9, after working with Louis Andriessen. Current projects include the CD release of “four scenes for Juliet” by the BU Wind Ensemble, and “Lina and the Wolf,” an opera on the life of Lina Prokofiev (based on the book “Lina and Serge: The Love and Wars of Lina Prokofiev,” by Simon Morrison). Ketty holds a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, a master’s from the Eastman School of Music, and bachelor’s degrees from the Curtis Institute of Music, and Bryn Mawr College.</p>

<p>Written in the summer of 2016 during the time I was composing “Lina and the Wolf” (an opera based on the life story of Lina Prokofiev), <strong><em>four scenes for Juliet</em></strong> takes as inspiration the story of Romeo and Juliet. The piece’s four large sections allude to scenes of “anticipation,” “balcony,” “echo,” and “hush.” “Echo” and “hush” began as arias from the opera. “Balcony” treats an abstraction of the contour of one of the love themes from Prokofiev’s ballet “Romeo and Juliet.” In general, musical textures are juxtaposed, overlapped, and fused in a Mondrian-like manner, with the intention of allowing the listener to perceive simultaneous streams of music (as if looking through scrims on a stage). The work was commissioned by David Martins and the Boston University Wind Ensemble, and premiered by these artists on February 16, 2017, and professionally recorded soon after.</p>

<p><strong><em>F I X E D HbeaRt</em></strong>: I never understood exactly what we are all trying to get to. The ascending lines of HbeaRt are my searching attempts for getting to a solid point. There are several random elements built into the live electronics that resemble the unexpected events of everyday life; yet, we continue to ascend. In the second movement however, I explore the emmotional components of being F I X E D and stuck in a situation, a terminal disease, war, etc. Even in such predicaments, the music begs for action and movement, inspired by the innate nature of life.</p>

<p>When I asked my friend Susan Stewart to write a set of poems for a new work for soprano, she responded with reflections on the mysterious prophetess spoken of in Virgil and Ovid. The sibyl sings of her prophecies written on leaves, and of how the god possesses her; she warns Aeneas before his descent to the underworld; she celebrates the moon. Having been granted eternal life, but failing to ask for eternal youth, she is reduced to no more than her voice. I understand the sibyl as an archetype of the musician who sings for us of fate and the mysteries of life, death, and love; who guides us in moonlit and shadowy places; and whose prophetic voice resounds unendingly, in power, and in vulnerability. <strong><em>A Sibyl</em></strong> was written for Collage New Music on a commission from the Fromm Music Foundation.</p>

<strong><em>Peppercorn Suite</em></strong>: _Movement 1: Black_ófor soprano and alto saxophones. The most common type of peppercorn, these are cooked green peppercorns that are then dried. They have the strongest flavor of the peppercorns. _Movement 2: Pink_ófor two soprano saxophones. Not actually peppercorns at all, but rather berries from a South American shrub. Most often used for garnishing, they have a delicate, floral taste. _Movement 3: Green_ófor alto and tenor saxophones. These are underripe black peppercorns that are often pickled. They have a fruity, slightly tart flavor. _Movement 4: White_ófor baritone and tenor saxophones. White peppercorns are simply black peppercorns that have been soaked and had the skins removed. The taste is less pungent, but more intense than black peppercorns.</p>

Found in numerous ancient cultures, an ouroboros is a depiction of a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, typically symbolizing eternity or cyclicality. Many of the musical materials in this work are cyclic in nature, with scales or interval patterns that are recursive in some way, exploring suggestions of infinity within a finite space. <strong><em>Ouroboros</em></strong> was composed in 2017 for the Bold City Contemporary Ensemble.</p>

<p><strong>Ash Stemke</strong> (b. 1991) “simply composes music he wants to hear, because it is beautiful, spouts no unpleasant theories, and manages nonetheless to avoid the too-well-known and trite.” (Steven Kruger, New York Arts). Aesthetically, Ash’s music is unified through elements of symmetry (proportion, balance, and self-similarity) and trajectory (teleology, argumentativeness, and transformation). In 2020, his 2014 film score to Georges Melies silent film <em>Le Voyage dans la Lune</em> will be sent on a literal trajectory 238,900-mile journey to the moon (!) as part of Carnegie-Mellon University’s MoonArk project. Ash recently won first prize in the San Francisco Choral Artists’ New Voices Project and has had music programmed by organizations such as the Boston New Music Initiative, New Music on the Bayou, and NSEME. Ash is currently a doctoral candidate (ABD) at Florida State University, where he studies composition with Clifton Callender and Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. www.ashstemke.com</p>

<p>I. Freshwater; II. Saltwater; III. To New Shores; The undulating feeling of push-and-pull found in river and ocean waters extends into every aspect of <strong><em>Currents</em></strong>: rhythmic vigor, metrical drive, harmonic tension, and melodic fluidity.  Inspired by the interconnectivity of all bodies of water, <em>Currents</em> follows a coursing river in its downhill surge, where it reaches a placid sea before flowing on “to new shores.”</p>

<p><strong>Stephen Andrew Taylor</strong> (1965-) composes music that explores boundaries between art and science. His first orchestra commission, Unapproachable Light, inspired by images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the New Testament, was premiered by the American Composers Orchestra in 1996 in Carnegie Hall. Other works include the quartet Quark Shadows, commissioned by the Chicago Symphony; Paradises Lost, an opera based on a novella by Ursula K. Le Guin, received its Canadian premiere in 2013, conducted by the composer. Besides traditional instruments, Taylor also works with technology in pieces such as Ocean of Air (2017) for Detroit Symphony principal trombonist Kenneth Thompkins, and Indian Hedgehog for saxophone and electronics, premiered by Debra Richtmeyer in Strasbourg in 2015. He grew up in Illinois and studied at Northwestern and Cornell Universities, and the California Institute of the Arts. A 2014-15 Fellow of the Guggenheim Foundation, he teaches at the University of Illinois.
In August 2017 our family saw the total eclipse. It was like nothing in the world Iíve ever seen, and weíre making plans for the next one on April 8, 2024. The moments just before totality, in the words of a friend, look like <strong><em>sunset in all directions</em></strong>. I was loosely thinking of the cello solo as the Moon; the low, brooding instruments as the Earth; and the highest, brightest instruments as the Sun. After introducing all three, the main part of the piece begins with a fast, spinning motive in the cello. The form of the piece consists of three celestial events: two partial eclipses, which I think of as ìnear misses,î and finally, the total eclipse. Twice, cross-rhythms in the two percussionists grow closer together, only to just miss each other. Then on the third attempt, after a cello cadenza, the percussive cross-rhythms once again grow closer, and finally join together as the strings all reach the same note, spread across eight octaves.</p>

<p><strong>John Wiggins</strong> is an award winning sound designer for TV and films and in 2017 won honorable mention at MA/IN InterMedia and Luc Ferrariís ìPresque Rienî competition. Using only sounds he records himself, he assembels short ìsound filmsî, made from everyday objects.
I record all the sounds I use in my studio and in the field. I only use ìM/Sî stereo mic techniques because I can more easily manipulate the resulting ìthree tracksî. I listen to my environment and record it. Then compose with dynamics, space, timbre, unfamiliarity, fun! Edited, mixed and combined - I find myself. <strong><em>Think Outside</em></strong> was made with recordings from January ñ March 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Nicholas Yamamoto</strong> (b. 1995) is a composer of acoustic and electroacoustic music. He is interested in the abstraction and juxtaposition of sound to transform aural image, subject, and environment. His work draws from a variety of social, physical, and aural experiences that can be encountered both inside and outside of the concert hall to create personal, evocative, and intense musical experiences. Recent compositions explore the connection between the performer, the audience, and their environment. This exploration stems from a multi-faceted career as a theatre collaborator and technician, most recently producing a work for James Turrellís Twilight Epiphany Skyspace at Rice University titled, ìa meditation on turrellî. Other recent works include dis.integrations for saxophone, written for the Moody Center for the Artsí installation of Josiah McElhenyís Island Universe, utilizing the unique acoustic qualities of the gallery. He is a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fixed Objects on a Moving Plane</em></strong> is an acousmatic composition designed for quadraphonic performance. This composition emphasizes the absence of visual data in order to create a spatially-flexible sonic environment. I seek to abstract the visual and physical identity of objects to illuminate their intrinsic musical properties. The sonic environment fluctuates to bring life and breath to the sound world, just as our own environments are constantly breathing and changing.</p>

<p><strong>Roger Zare</strong> has been praised for his ìenviable grasp of orchestrationî (New York Times) and for writing music with ìformal clarity and an alluringly mercurial surface.î Often inspired by science, nature, and mythology, his works have been performed across the United States and on five continents by such musicians and ensembles as the American Composers Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra, Boston Musica Viva, the Donald Sinta Quartet, violinist Cho-Liang Lin, and clarinetist Alexander Fiterstein. Zareís awards include the ASCAP Nissim Prize, three BMI Student Composer Awards, an ASCAP Morton Gould award, the 2008 ACO Underwood Commission, a Copland House Residency Award, and a Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Zare holds degrees from the University of Michigan, the Peabody Conservatory, and the University of Southern California. Zare currently serves as an instructional assistant professor of music theory and composition at Illinois State University.
<strong><em>Inferno</em></strong> describes the famous fate of the Phoenix bird ñ its death and rebirth by fire. It begins with a frenzied build that yields to a moto perpetuo theme of running 16th notes, ducking and dodging and heating up. Eventually, it explodes into a rhythmically charged section, punctuated by col legno strings and a syncopated interplay between brass and winds. The running moto perpetuo idea returns after a sizzling encounter with harmon-muted brass, and proceeds to a massive chorale. From this point until the end, the music swirls and burns as the Phoenix bird is engulfed in an out-of-control blaze of glory.</p>
