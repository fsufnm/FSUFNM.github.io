<p><strong><em>Garden of Eros</em></strong> (Tuin van Eros) is based upon an idea which is unusual, if not completely wrong for a string quartet: a piece for solo violin, accompanied by three string instruments.</p>

<p>While composing it, I realised that this idea was not far away from the roots of the string quartet: Haydn’s early quartets. However, the piece does not sound like Haydn.</p>

<p>The title comes from a long and beautiful love poem in 50 quatrains written by Jan Engelman in 1934. I follow the sentiment of the poem somewhat loosely in the music, but the structure of the poem quite rigidly: the piece contains as many beats as the poem contains syllables.</p>

<p>The work lasts 12 minutes and is written for Arditti Quartet, to the memory of my brother Jurriaan, the composer.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<p>The idea behind <strong><em>Zilver</em></strong> was to write a chorale variation as Bach did for organ: a long, slow-moving melody, combined with the same melody played faster. The ensemble is divided into two groups: the wind and strings play the sustained melody in chorale-like four-part harmony, and the rest of the instruments – vibraphone, marimba and piano – play increasingly fast staccato chords. The two groups play in canons.</p>

<p>Zilver is one of a planned series of chamber pieces named after a type of physical matter. Hout (‘wood’) is the first, and Zilver (‘silver’) is the second. The title also refers to the two silver instruments – flute and vibraphone – which start and end the piece.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Louis Andriessen</strong> was born in Utrecht in 1939 into a musical family: his father Hendrik, and his brother Jurriaan were established composers in their own right. Andriessen studied with his father and Kees van Baaren at the Hague Conservatory, and between 1962 and 1964 undertook further studies in Milan and Berlin with Luciano Berio. Since 1974 he has combined teaching with his work as a composer and pianist. He is now widely regarded as the leading composer working in the Netherlands today and is a central figure in the international new music scene.</p>

<p>From a background of jazz and avant-garde composition, Andriessen has evolved a style employing elemental harmonic, melodic and rhythmic materials, heard in totally distinctive instrumentation. His acknowledged admiration for Stravinsky is illustrated by a parallel vigour, clarity of expression, and acute ear for colour. The range of Andriessen’s inspiration is wide, from the music of Charles Ives in <em>Anachronie I</em>, the art of Mondriaan in <em>De Stijl</em>, and medieval poetic visions in <em>Hadewijch</em>, to writings on shipbuilding and atomic theory in <em>De Materie Part I</em>. He has tackled complex creative issues, exploring the relation between music and politics in <em>De Staat</em>, the nature of time and velocity in <em>De Tijd</em> and <em>De Snelheid</em>, and questions of mortality in <em>Trilogy of the Last Day</em>.</p>

<p>Andriessen’s compositions have attracted many leading exponents of contemporary music, including the two Dutch groups named after his works De Volharding and Hoketus. Other eminent Dutch performers include Asko Schoenberg, Nieuw Amsterdams Peil, the Schoenberg Quartet, pianists Gerard Bouwhuis and Cees van Zeeland, and conductors Reinbert de Leeuw and Lucas Vis. Groups outside the Netherlands who have commissioned or performed his works include the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Kronos Quartet, London Sinfonietta, Ensemble Modern, MusikFabrik, Icebreaker and the Bang on a Can All Stars.</p>

<p>Collaborative works with other artists include a series of dance projects, the full length theatre piece <em>De Materie</em> created with Robert Wilson for the Netherlands Opera, and three works created with Peter Greenaway: the film <em>M is for Man, Music, Mozart</em>, and the stage works <em>ROSA Death of a Composer</em> and <em>Writing to Vermeer</em>, premiered at the Netherlands Opera in 1994 and 1999 respectively. Collaborations with film maker Hal Hartley have included <em>The New Math(s)</em> in 2000 and <em>La Commedia</em>, an operatic setting of Dante for Netherlands Opera premiered at the Holland Festival in 2008. Nonesuch Records has released a series of recordings of Andriessen’s major works, including the complete <em>De Materie</em>, <em>ROSA Death of a Composer</em> and <em>Writing to Vermeer</em>.</p>

<p>Commissions since 2010 include the music theatre piece <em>Anaïs Nin</em> for singer Cristina Zavalloni and 8 musicians and <em>La Girò</em> for violinist Monica Germino and large ensemble premiered at MITO SettembreMusica in 2011. The 2013/14 season brought premieres of <em>Mysteriën</em> by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Mariss Jansons and <em>Tapdance</em> for percussion and large ensemble with Colin Currie in the ZaterdagMatinee series in Amsterdam. His new opera <em>Theatre of the World</em> received first performances in Los Angeles and Amsterdam in 2016.</p>

<p>Louis Andriessen held the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer’s Chair at Carnegie Hall, New York, and was awarded Composer of the Year Award by Musical America in 2010. He won the 2011 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition for his opera La Commedia, which was released on CD and DVD by Nonesuch in 2014.</p>

<p>The opening of <strong><em>The Hague Hacking</em></strong> refers to an existing piece, which was in my mind while composing, but could not be tracked down immediately. I called a composer friend and sang the melody to him. ‘Liszt!’ he said and, after some thinking, ‘Hungarian Rhapsody No.2’. I did not know the Liszt piano piece but, when one evening I watched some early Tom and Jerry cartoons again, I saw and heard my true source: <em>The Cat Concerto</em>. In the cartoon Tom is the piano virtuoso accompanied by an invisible orchestra.</p>

<p>In <em>The Hague Hacking</em> the orchestra starts to play, in very slow note values, yet another melody: a once popular sing-along song about the city of The Hague. The whole work, which we could call a Toccata, has been composed with the material of these two melodies.</p>

<p>At the end of the piece, as a kind of triumphant denouement, the sing-along song is totally deconstructed by all the musicians. The material for this ‘de-composition’ had been first created in 2003 for my friends, the piano duo of Gerard Bouwhuis and Cees van Zeeland, as an encore for the concert on the occasion of their 25th anniversary.</p>

<p><em>The Hague Hacking</em> was written for the matchless pianists Katia and Marielle Labèque. Like the group Hoketus, which I founded in the seventies, they manage to make the hocketing (interlocking) sound as if it is being played by one person.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel Barkley</strong> is a Belfast-based Irish composer currently in the third year of his doctoral studies under Professor Piers Hellawell at Queen’s University, Belfast. He achieved a distinction in his MA and a first class honours BMus at the same institution studying with Prof. Hellawell and Dr Simon Mawhinney. Recent performances include those by the Fidelio Trio, the RTE ConTempo Quartet, the Hard Rain SoloistEnsemble, etc. His works have been played throughout Ireland, the UK, and further afield. He was recently awarded an Honorary Mention in the first annual Peter Rosser Composition Competition.</p>

<p>In <strong><em>I Am Vertical / But I would rather be horizontal</em></strong>, I experiment with an emergent approach to the technique known as formula composition. The harmonic structure is defined by the melody on which the piece is primarily focused. The melody itself is revealed gradually, bit by bit, and is only heard in full at the very end.</p>

<p>Praised by The New York Times as a composer of “ear-grabbing invention,” <strong>Fernando Benadon</strong> is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, Tanglewood’s Fromm Foundation Award, Copland House’s Aaron Copland Award, the League of Composers/ISCM composition prize, UC-Berkeley’s Ladd Prize, and numerous commissions. His debut album <em>Intuitivo</em> – called “equal parts engrossing, maddening, and bewildering” by sequenza21.com – brought together top musicians for a kaleidoscopic collage of improvisation. As a scholar, he publishes actively in leading journals and serves on the editorial board of Music Theory Spectrum. A native of Buenos Aires and graduate of Berklee (BM) and UC-Berkeley (PhD), he is associate professor at American University.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rhythmensional</em></strong> showcases drummer Dafnis Prieto (2011 MacArthur Fellow), whose solo improvisation (created specifically for this project) serves as the foundation for a live ensemble that is superposed with the drums. The live players follow a score and perform alongside Dafnis’s pre-recorded solo, creating a superposition of past and present musical events. At the outset of the piece, Dafnis’s playing sparks new ideas that spread through the ensemble; this is followed by a playful and often fiery dialogue between both parties.</p>

<p><strong>Benjamin Broening</strong>’s music couples his interest in the expressive power of sound with a sense of line derived from his background as a singer. A recipient of Guggenheim, Howard and Fulbright Fellowships, Broening has also received recognition and awards from the American Composers Forum, Virginia Commission for the Arts, ACS/Andrew Mellon Foundation, the Jerome Foundation, the Presser Music Foundation, and a teaching award from the University of Richmond. In addition to two solo CDs on the Bridge and Innova labels (recorded by eighth blackbird and duo runedako respectively), his music has also been released by Ensemble U: in Estonia and on the Centaur, Everglade, Equilibrium, MIT Press, Oberlin Music, Open G and SEAMUS record labels. Broening is founder and artistic director of Third Practice, an annual festival of electroacoustic music at the University of Richmond, where he is Professor of Music and Associate Dean of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>

<p><strong><em>gathering light</em></strong> for violin and electronics grew out of a piece I wrote in 2008 for the Estonian sextet Ensemble U:. That piece, changing light, was one of several I have written in the past few years that imperfectly reflect my experience of being in Estonia: <em>Dark Wood</em> for cello evokes the feeling of being in the Estonian forests, <em>Trembling Air</em> for flute evokes a the quality of energy of the air there filled as it is with the sound of birds, of trees, of water, and <em>changing light</em> tries to capture my experience of the magical and changeable quality of Estonian light. <em>changing light</em> ends with an extended violin solo, the material and sound world of which seemed to demand further exploration. I revisit my exploration of the liminal light of the Estonian pre-dawn and the material of that violin solo in gathering light.</p>

<p><strong><em>Canonic Offerings</em></strong> is based on my work with canons that have an infinite number of solutions. These are maximally self-similar melodic lines that can be combined successfully and performed simultaneously by any number of voices, each voice at its own tempo yielding either rational or irrational tempo ratios, with the melody moving either forward or backward. In <em>Canonic Offerings</em> I have selected a small number of these combinations based on three such melodies, attempting to give the flavor of the combinatorial possibilities within the context of a unified (and finite) composition.</p>

<p>Star Ferry is a major tourist attraction in Hong Kong. It has more than a hundred years of history, and the ferry carries passengers across the Victoria Harbour. As people wait for the ride and get aboard, one can hear the low-pitched ferry horn, beeps from the gates, lots of footsteps, and of course, water. I try to capture the sounds and the motion of the ferry in this piece. The tuba represents the movement of the ferry, from getting ready to depart to its arrival on the other side of the Harbour, while the piano mimics the environmental noise where the ferry locates. The pitch content of <strong><em>A Star Ferry Ride</em></strong> is completely taken from the opening gestures of the tuba part. They are arranged in a 9-chord series and are played several times before the series retrogrades.</p>

<p><strong><em>In Void</em></strong> has five sections: water, fire, air, soil and void. Each section is named after one of the five basic elements of the Universe from ancient philosophy. Each section represents the composer’s sonic interpretation of the individual element. The title is from the idea that the void encompasses the rest of the elements.</p>

<p><strong><em>Huis clos</em></strong> is piece for solo piano, inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre’s play of the same title. The entire play takes place in a single room and features only four characters. As the play unfolds, the audience realizes that three of the characters have died and are in Hell. They each secretly ponder upon the sort of severe torture that awaits them, and come to realize that each simultaneously serves as tormentor and victim to one another in a hell sculpted simply by the gaze of the Other, a torture worse than all physical brutality. Like the play, the tension in the music lies deep beneath the surface with the occasional outburst. The piece opens with a repeated figure that comes to dominate the musical texture. Although there is a fair amount of activity on the musical surface, it gradually breaks down, and the overall trajectory of the piece is static, reflecting the stifling vapidity found in most of the play’s dialogue that thinly veil the weighty philosophical themes within.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew Conklin</strong> is a composer, songwriter, and guitarist based in Brooklyn, NY. He writes music that borrows with equal comfort from American popular music traditions and contemporary classical practices and aesthetics. He lives for collaborations with kindred curious musicmakers, and has enjoyed fruitful partnerships with musicians from a diverse cross section of today’s most inquisitive and probing collectives, including the International Contemporary Ensemble, Tune-Yards, Yarn/Wire, Earplay, Tala Rasa Percussion, and the Calidore String Quartet. His music has been championed by institutions such as the New York Foundation for the Arts, New Music on the Point, and Vox Novus, and his performances have ranged throughout the United States and Europe, at venues including Le Poisson Rouge and Spectrum (New York), the Ford Amphitheatre (Los Angeles), and Point Ephémère (Paris). In addition to teaching at Stony Brook University, he performs regularly with Michael Rocketship and Laurie Lewis.</p>

<p>American composers have long been fascinated by nature; the canon is filled with works that invoke the awe-inspiring majesty of the country’s landscape. In <strong><em>Five Pieces for String Quartet</em></strong>, however, I am interested in nature on a microbiological scale. I am thinking not about mountains, but microbes. In this spirit, the work explores the quirks of small-scale musical and physical form—the longest movement (“Organism”) is just over four minutes long; the shortest (“Breath”) is forty seconds. The piece can be performed in its full electroacoustic form or as a solely acoustic piece; in the case of the the latter, the second and fourth movements are omitted.</p>

<p>I was intrigued by the idea of writing for this instrumental combination, because I find areas of similarity and contrast between the sax &amp; trombone quartets. Both the trombones and saxophones are made of brass and exude a certain powerful timbre. That trombones should produce this power is perhaps not surprising. However, one does not tend to think of woodwind instruments as “powerful.” The saxophone family is the exception to this rule. This may well be due to the origins of the saxophone. The instrument can trace its development back to the ophicleide, a keyed brass instrument of the 19th century. Despite taking advantage of some timbral similarities, the piece also seeks to highlight the unique differences between the two instrumental families. There is no programmatic element to <strong><em>eight shades of metal</em></strong>. Given my interest in fast, rhythmic music, I sought to create a rollicking good time for the performers. It’s my hope that this translates well and that audiences experience a similar joy.</p>

<p>I began to assemble the poems of <strong><em>The White Album</em></strong> during a residency at Copland House where I poured through hundreds of poems before selecting those by four Americans (Mark Strand, James Merrill, Linda Pastan and Erica Funkhouser). The cycle’s primary unifying element is the color white, which appears at least once in each poem. But the poems share other themes, most notably love, loss, life and death, if not some expectation of renewal. As I began to work with them in earnest I was struck by their common imagery: trees (leaves, branches, limbs), laundry (sheets, towels, clothes), light (sun, moon, morning, night), weather (snow, ice, cloud-clot, lightning) and windows with their views on internal and external worlds, to name just a few. There are musical motifs as well. Of course many of these similarities can be traced to their association with the color white, but there is a kinship that runs much, much deeper. As Mark Strand’s poem concludes, “All things are one.” The performance on this festival will include the first two songs, “White” and “The Mad Scene.”</p>

<p><strong><em>Parallax</em></strong> explores the violin as an object of both sound and performance. Sounds were constructed using my PVCplus audio processing software and individual tone samples taken principally from the violin. Sounds were designed and sequenced so as to present the listener with trajectories of timbre, tuning, and space. As each trajectory advances, the listening experience is reframed or shifted, suggesting, perhaps, a kind of auditory parallax that pits our memory of the instrument against the work’s more skewed forms of it.</p>

<p><strong>Peter Kramer</strong> was born in Portland, Oregon (b.1989) where he studied composition, piano and violin with Dr. Marshall Tuttle at Mount Hood Community College. He has recently graduated from the Oberlin Conservatory (2014) with a double major in Composition and Harpsichord Performance, and is currently pursuing his PhD in Composition at the CUNY Graduate Center, studying with Jason Eckardt. His principal teachers also include Dr. Lewis Nielson and Webb William Wiggins. Peter’s music focuses on “musical parasites” i.e. residual and musical anomalies/artifacts resulting from performance paired with the resonant sound-world of 16th and 17th century music, particularly keyboard and choral repertoires, as well as the sound world of American folk and blues traditions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Eolian</em></strong> refers to the mode that is today commonly known as the Aeolian mode, finding its roots in the name of the Greek god “ruler of the winds” Aeolus. Structurally this solo is based on the prelude and fugue model of the baroque era, and is in part inspired by the instrument known as the Aeolian harp, an instrument placed outside or at an open window whereby the strings are put into motion by wind alone. This piece is dedicated to and was premiered by my close friend William Overcash.</p>

<p>The poetry of the Japanese <em>haiku</em>, a tradition that has existed for more than three hundred years, has inspired me for a long time. When I decided to compose my first haiku, the focus of my creativity was exploring the many compositional possibilities hidden within the miniature form. However, it was soon revealed to me the depth at which this specific genre of Japanese poetry reflects the coalescensce of life, death, and our fundamental connection with nature. Thus, the concept of <strong><em>14 Haiku</em></strong> emerged. Recently, I have extended this cycle to twenty four parts. <em>24 Haiku</em> was published by Triga and recorded for the NEOS label. It is dedicated to its first performers, mezzo-soprano Phyllis Pancella and pianist Hui-Ting Yang.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sleep’s Undulating Tide</em></strong> takes its inspiration from Margaret Atwood’s poem “Variations on the Word Sleep.” Her expressive text reveals desire, intimacy, and longing –  “I would like to sleep with you, to enter your sleep as its smooth dark wave slides over my head.” Atwood’s imagery progresses through a dream-like state where she desires to accompany her lover through the beauty of a “lucent wavering forest of bluegreen leaves” and then into a foreboding darkness “towards the cave where you must descend, toward your worst fear.” Her continuing journey  references Orpheus’s descent into hell to rescue Eurydice by yearning to “become the boat that would row you back carefully.” Atwood’s evocative poem ends with a simple yet profound expression to “be the air that inhabits you for a moment only,” with its intent to be simultaneously unimportant yet vital. <em>Sleeps Undulating Tide</em> was commissioned by Phoenix Concerts for Lindsey Goodman and is dedicated to her with appreciation and admiration.</p>

<p><strong>Fernanda Navarro</strong> is a composer born in Brazil based in San Diego, California. 
She’s a PhD candidate at UCSD, studying with Rand Steiger and Roger Reynolds. She had pieces performed in Europe, Brazil, Argentina and the US, and participated in several contemporary music festivals such as Darmstadt Summer Festival, Visiones Sonoras and Harvard Festival . She’s engaged with promoting contemporary music and worked as producer/curator of concerts and music festivals such as FIME (Festival Internacional de Música Experimental), and SpringFest. She enjoys working in collaboration with soloists and had pieces performed by ensembles such as Talea,Yarn/Wire, Platypus and Gnarwhallaby. She composes electroacoustic music, has been exploring performance art and installations. 
Fernanda doesn’t like to be reduced to a gender,doesn’t know how to samba, procrastinates to write program notes, doesn’t know how to react to compliments or critiques, goes to the cinema every week drinks coffee everyday.</p>

<p>Moving to a foreign country forced me to deal with the idea that I am “the other”: I’m a non-citizen, an alien, “the international student”, “the Brazilian girl”, “the female composer from Brazil”. It was strange to see my whole identity become so intensely bound to the country in which I was born and my gender. Some thoughts about being uprooted, culturally inadequate, socially dis-empowered and artistically overlooked set the tone of <strong><em>Otherness</em></strong>. In this piece I worked with materials that were radically different from each other and tried to manipulate them to find points of similarities, either via physical gesture, timbre, melodic shape and/or rhythmic patterns. The idea of being in someone else’s shoes -as a way of understanding different perspectives and then being able to incorporate and/or transform these perspectives - colored the way I treated the instruments in this piece, as well as some decisions about form.</p>

<p>Composer/pianist <strong>Ketty Nez</strong> joined the Boston University School of Music in 2005, after teaching for two years at the University of Iowa. Her folk opera, <em>The Fiddler and the Old Woman of Rumelia</em>, was premiered 2011 by Xanthos Ensemble, and staged by the Juventas Ensemble in 2012. Ketty’s portrait CD, <em>Listen to a Wonder Never Heard Before!</em>, was released in 2010 by Albany Records, and her piano concerto, <em>thresholds</em>, with the Boston University Wind Ensemble, was released by Ravello Records in 2013. Ketty completed a residence of several months at the Ecole Nationale de Musique in Montbeliard, France, prior to the premiere of her chamber opera <em>An Opera in Devolution: Drama in 540 Seconds</em>, at the 2003 Seventh Festival A•Devantgarde in Munich. Ketty studied at IRCAM in 1998-9, after working for two years in Amsterdam with Louis Andriessen. Current projects include Lina and the Wolf, an opera on the life of Lina Prokofiev, based on the book <em>Lina and Serge</em> by Simon Morrison.</p>

<p>Written during the summer of 2009, <strong><em>in transit</em></strong> was inspired by Béla Bartók’s ethnomusicological research on the music of various cultures of East Europe and Asia Minor. I was drawn not only to the sheer sonic qualities of the songs themselves, but also by the fact that every song is a story. Melodic material is based on Bartók’s annotations of a Turkish folksong from Asia Minor: “how should I praise such a beauty: she mingled her hair with golden twine.” In a brusque manner, eventually dominating the musical discourse, are quotations of my own setting of a Bosnian folksong, “The Old Mother of Dzhaferbeg.” The text of this second song recounts the lurid tale of a jealous old mother wrongly accusing her beautiful daughter-in-law of an affair, and the resulting murder of the innocent woman by the enraged husband. My setting featured the textures of the “kemence” fiddle accompaniment in addition to the vocal line. The piano mimics the “kemence,” and the (Western) violin wailing voices.</p>

In 1994 he was in residence at the Marlboro Music Festival. 19 of his compositions are available on CD. He has taught at University of Pennsylvania since 1988.</p>

<p>Composing this cycle of songs began with my discovery of three poems in Susan Stewart’s collection Columbarium that I knew I must set to music. The deep, dreamlike wisdom of these poems haunted me, just as I had experienced with Susan’s poem “Cinder” that had served as the fulcrum of my song cycle Holy the Firm. Eventually, texts by Rilke and an earlier setting I had done of a psalm verse were drawn into the gravitational orbit of Susan’s poems. I ordered the texts in a nearly symmetrical pattern, with two texts set a second time in versions that shadow their first readings. This is partly for the sake of the formal design, but, more importantly, to re-examine the poems in the penumbra of what comes before. Rounding the cycle in this way reflects not only the circles and repetitions in Susan Stewart’s texts, but also the way in which, as Rilke writes, the things we have let go of yet encircle us. <strong><em>Dark the Star</em></strong> was premiered by William Sharp and the 21st Century Consort.</p>

Simultaneously, she has also been experimenting at the McGill Digital Composition Studios, studying with Philippe Leroux. She is composer in residence for the McGill Contemporary Music Ensemble under the direction of conductor Guillaume Bourgogne. Paola received her MM degree from Rice University and her Licentiate in music composition from Trinity College London. She has been the recipient of several awards and fellowships including the Fulbright Scholarship. Her piece <em>Nemesis</em> represented Mexico at the UNESCO’s 57th International Rostrum of Composers. Her piece <em>Fractum</em> is published by Alea Publishing &amp; Recording.</p>

<p>In Astronomy, the Nemesis Hypothesis postulates that our sun may have a yet undetected companion star called “Nemesis”. When the Nemesis star’s orbit brings it closer to our solar system, its gravity disturbs the Oort cloud, a mass of comets one light-year from the sun. As a result of these disturbances, a high number of comets are driven through the inner solar system, with a resulting increase in impact events on earth. K-T, the massive dinosaur extinction of the Cretaceous-Tertiary period, is an example of such an event. 
   <strong><em>Nemesis</em></strong>, for chamber orchestra, is divided into three sections: the “Nemesis” music is grounded and solid; the “Oort cloud” music is more vaporous and mysterious; and the “K-T” impact music is rhythmic and forceful. Musical motives, drawn from a nine-tone source scale, help to link the three sections, creating a musical analogue for this intriguing cosmic phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Aaron Spotts</strong> (b.1980) is a composer originally from Washington state, studying with Dr. Roger Briggs, and receiving his bachelors degree from Western Washington University in 2008. He earned his masters degree in composition from Florida State University (FSU) in 2015, where he is currently continuing study with Dr. Ladislav Kubik as a doctoral student. His recent activities have included: holding the Zwilich graduate assistantship in ’15-’16, which focused on orchestral studies under Dr. Alex Jimenez in conjunction with the FSU orchestras; the premier of his <em>Two Days’ Bar Talk</em> at the 2016 SCI Region VI conference; and having his string quartet chosen as a finalist for the 2016 Bruno Maderna Composition Competition, taking place the last week of July in Lviv, Ukraine.</p>

<p><strong><em>Two Days’ Bar Talk</em></strong>, written for a Duo Rodinia commission in 2014, is inspired by personal compositional material I accumulated over a number of years. When envisioning the piece in the early stages of the writing process, I had an epiphany that these unused and separately conceived ideas had a common character somewhat reminiscent of Bartók. I subsequently employed them in pursuit of this connection, composing them out and tying them together with music that altogether framed a rhythmically driven and dynamic musical form that somewhat imitates the folk music that influenced Bartók. Thus, the title, whose surface meaning may allude to the boisterous atmosphere of a bar for “two days” (outer sections, which are separated by a slower “late night” section), also has a second, more apt meaning: today’s Bartók.</p>

<p><strong>Stephen Andrew Taylor</strong> composes music that explores boundaries between art and science. His first orchestra commission, <em>Unapproachable Light</em>—inspired by images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the New Testament—was premiered by the American Composers Orchestra in 1996 in Carnegie Hall. Other works include the quartet <em>Quark Shadows</em>, commissioned by the Chicago Symphony; and <em>Seven Memorials</em>, a 30-minute cycle for piano inspired by the work of Maya Lin and featured at Tanglewood in 2006. <em>The Machine Awakes</em>, a CD of his orchestra, chamber and electronic music, was released in 2010 on Albany Records. <em>Paradises Lost</em>, an opera based on a novella by Ursula K. Le Guin, received its Toronto premiere in 2013, conducted by the composer. In popular music he has worked with Pink Martini and rock singer Storm Large. A 2014 Guggenheim fellow, Taylor is Professor of Music at the University of Illinois, where he lives with his spouse, artist Hua Nian, and their two children.</p>

<p>The ancient gene <strong><em>Hox</em></strong>, found in everything from people to sea cucumbers, has the crucial job of telling where to put our heads and our tails. This saxophone quartet is in three parts: the first, “Homeobox,” represents the oldest section of the gene, conserved for millions of years; it refers to a chunk of DNA (the box) that stays the same (homeo). The rhythms are sonifications of the four bases (CATG), while the harmonies represent the amino acids that the DNA encodes; these form the Hox protein. In the second movement, “Helix turn helix,” melodies and canons are based on a part of this protein whose job is to latch onto DNA (here, fast descending scales) and unwind it, so its instructions can be read by other genes. Finally, the last movement, “From head to tail” is an impression of the gene doing its job: at first, its melodic gestures start only to end in dissolution. But gradually, the end becomes more forceful, culminating in a group of chords that grow more and more emphatic.</p>

<p><strong>Daniel J. Thompson</strong> is a composer and improviser primarily fixated on electroacoustic and algorithmic music. His chamber works have been performed in New York City and Tokyo, and in 2014, his piano etude <em>electronumbcomfy</em> was selected as a finalist in the BMI Student Composer Awards. In addition to creative endeavors, Daniel is also active in music scholarship, with a primary focus on semiotic approaches to meaning in East-Coast jazz of the 1950s and 60s. He has presented this work at several music theory conferences–including the national meeting of the Society for Music Theory (SMT). Currently residing in Tallahassee, FL, Daniel is pursuing a PhD in music theory–where he has also served as a graduate teaching assistantship in both the areas of music theory and jazz studies.</p>

<p><strong><em>remnants</em></strong> is a work for clarinet and computer that plays on the notion of indexicality (C.S. Peirce)—in which a signifier is produced by that which it signifies. For instance, a hangover might index a night of celebration (or despair), just as the smell of smoke might index a cigarette. In <em>remnants</em>, this effect is achieved musically by the processing of the lyrical clarinet material by the computer (using patches coded in SuperCollider)—resulting in a texture whose source is audibly a clarinet, but only a trace of it. This work is ultimately a contemplation of the union between meaningful events in our lives and the souvenirs that index them, as well as the transience of human consciousness. How meaningful are our memories if our brains constantly change, reshape, and distort the recollection of experiences that make us who we are? If you prefer not to ponder such infinite subjectivity and chaos, just follow the ABCB form of the movement for syntactic comfort. ; )</p>

<p>Based on the dramatic creation story outlined in the Book of Genesis in the Bible, <strong><em>Genesis</em></strong> is a one movement work for orchestra that was inspired by the seven days of creation according to the Bible. Within the work, there are eight subdivisions and themes that allude to the various processes that occur during creation. The subdivisions are 1) Formlessness and Chaos 2) Day &amp; Night 3) Separation of the Vaults 4) Dry Land 5) Stars, Sun, &amp; Moon 6) Creatures of the Sea and Sky 7) Mankind; Glorious Dance of the Earth 8) Nocturne; The Seventh Day.</p>

<p><strong><em>7/whispers</em></strong> is a spatially conceived septet in which the most important things occur in a whisper. The original Czech title “Šeptet” is a play on words, a combination of “Šeptat” (to whisper) and “Septet”. It increasingly appears to me that, these days, human communication begins and ends with stock phrases. Such phrases are polite and courteous, because they are devoid of all true emotion. Instead of proper understanding, we achieve the exact opposite. We misapprehend others; we put up defenses to protect ourselves against their sincerity. We start to think in platitudes when we are toddlers. If we want to perceive others, we have to study the subtle signs: the hushed, unspoken gestures, involuntary signals, things that slip out by chance. And what has my <em>7/whispers</em> in common with all this? Its main theme is receptiveness, a fragile microclimate for whispered communication. But we need to do more than just whisper… Commissioned by the Prague Spring festival in 2014.</p>
