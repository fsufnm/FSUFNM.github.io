**Peter Kramer** was born in Portland, Oregon (b.1989) where he studied composition, piano and violin with Dr. Marshall Tuttle at Mount Hood Community College. He has recently graduated from the Oberlin Conservatory (2014) with a double major in Composition and Harpsichord Performance, and is currently pursuing his PhD in Composition at the CUNY Graduate Center, studying with Jason Eckardt. His principal teachers also include Dr. Lewis Nielson and Webb William Wiggins. Peter’s music focuses on “musical parasites” i.e. residual and musical anomalies/artifacts resulting from performance paired with the resonant sound-world of 16th and 17th century music, particularly keyboard and choral repertoires, as well as the sound world of American folk and blues traditions.

**_Eolian_** refers to the mode that is today commonly known as the Aeolian mode, finding its roots in the name of the Greek god “ruler of the winds” Aeolus. Structurally this solo is based on the prelude and fugue model of the baroque era, and is in part inspired by the instrument known as the Aeolian harp, an instrument placed outside or at an open window whereby the strings are put into motion by wind alone. This piece is dedicated to and was premiered by my close friend William Overcash.
 
Eolic “...was fittest for lyric verses, as having a particular sweetness mixed with gravity.
—Brossard Dictionary (1703)
