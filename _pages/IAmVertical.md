In **_I Am Vertical / But I would rather be horizontal_**, I experiment with an emergent approach to the technique known as formula composition. The harmonic structure is defined by the melody on which the piece is primarily focused. The melody itself is revealed gradually, bit by bit, and is only heard in full at the very end.
