**_Two Days' Bar Talk_**, written for a Duo Rodinia commission in 2014, is inspired by personal compositional material I accumulated over a number of years. When envisioning the piece in the early stages of the writing process, I had an epiphany that these unused and separately conceived ideas had a common character somewhat reminiscent of Bartók. I subsequently employed them in pursuit of this connection, composing them out and tying them together with music that altogether framed a rhythmically driven and dynamic musical form that somewhat imitates the folk music that influenced Bartók. Thus, the title, whose surface meaning may allude to the boisterous atmosphere of a bar for "two days" (outer sections, which are separated by a slower "late night" section), also has a second, more apt meaning: today's Bartók.
