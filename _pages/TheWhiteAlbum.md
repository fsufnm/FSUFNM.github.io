**Mark Kilstofte** is "admired as a composer of lyrical line, engaging harmony, strong, dramatic gesture and keen sensitivity to sound, shape and event." Praised by the San Francisco Chronicle as “exciting and beautiful, consistently gripping,” his music has garnered a growing number of awards and honors including the Rome Prize, the Guggenheim Fellowship, ASCAP’s Rudolf Nissim Award, and the Goddard Lieberson Fellowship and Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His music, performed regularly throughout North America and Europe, has been featured on NPR’s Performance Today and From the Top and heard in concert halls from Moscow to Bangkok. Kilstofte is a graduate of St. Olaf College and The University of Michigan. He currently teaches composition at Furman University and is a visiting professor at the University of Oslo’s Center for Ibsen Studies, where he is writing an opera based on Ibsen’s Brand. His music is published by the Newmatic Press.

I began to assemble the poems of **_The White Album_** during a residency at Copland House where I poured through hundreds of poems before selecting those by four Americans (Mark Strand, James Merrill, Linda Pastan and Erica Funkhouser). The cycle’s primary unifying element is the color white, which appears at least once in each poem. But the poems share other themes, most notably love, loss, life and death, if not some expectation of renewal. As I began to work with them in earnest I was struck by their common imagery: trees (leaves, branches, limbs), laundry (sheets, towels, clothes), light (sun, moon, morning, night), weather (snow, ice, cloud-clot, lightning) and windows with their views on internal and external worlds, to name just a few. There are musical motifs as well. Of course many of these similarities can be traced to their association with the color white, but there is a kinship that runs much, much deeper. As Mark Strand’s poem concludes, “All things are one.” The performance on this festival will include the first two songs, "White" and "The Mad Scene."

2\. The Mad Scene

Again last night I dreamed the dream called Laundry.<br>
In it, the sheets and towels of a life we were going to share, <br>
The milk-stiff bibs, the shroud, each rag to be ever <br>
Trampled or soiled, bled on or groped for blindly,<br>
Came swooning out of an enormous willow hamper<br>
Onto moon-marbly boards. We had just met. I watched <br>
From outer darkness. I had dressed myself in clothes<br>
Of a new fiber that never stains or wrinkles, never<br>
Wears thin. The opera house sparkled with tiers<br>
And tiers of eyes, like mine enlarged by belladonna, <br>
Trained inward. There I saw the cloud-clot, gust by gust, <br>
Form, and the lightning bite, and the roan mane unloosen. <br>
Fingers were running in panic over the flute’s nine gates. <br>
Why did I flinch? I loved you. And in the downpour laughed <br>
To have us wrung white, gnarled together, one<br>
Topmost mordent of wisteria,<br>
As the lean tree burst into grief.

James Merrill <br>
(1926-1995) 

3\. I Am Learning To Abandon the World

I am learning to abandon the world <br>
before it can abandon me.<br>
Already I have given up the moon <br>
and snow, closing my shades <br>
against the claims of white.<br>
And the world has taken<br>
my father, my friends.<br>
I have given up melodic lines of hills, <br>
moving to a flat, tuneless landscape. <br>
And every night I give my body up<br>
limb by limb, working upwards<br>
across bone, towards the heart.<br>
But morning comes with small<br>
reprieves of coffee and birdsong.<br>
A tree outside the window<br>
which was simply shadow moments ago <br>
takes back its branches twig<br>
by leafy twig.<br>
And as I take my body back<br>
the sun lays its warm muzzle on my lap <br>
as if to make amends.

Linda Pastan <br>
(b. 1932)
