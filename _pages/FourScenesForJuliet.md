Written in the summer of 2016 during the time I was composing "Lina and the Wolf" (an opera based on the life story of Lina Prokofiev), **_four scenes for Juliet_** takes as inspiration the story of Romeo and Juliet. The piece's four large sections allude to scenes of "anticipation," "balcony," "echo," and "hush." "Echo" and "hush" began as arias from the opera. "Balcony" treats an abstraction of the contour of one of the love themes from Prokofiev's ballet "Romeo and Juliet." In general, musical textures are juxtaposed, overlapped, and fused in a Mondrian-like manner, with the intention of allowing the listener to perceive simultaneous streams of music (as if looking through scrims on a stage). The work was commissioned by David Martins and the Boston University Wind Ensemble, and premiered by these artists on February 16, 2017, and professionally recorded soon after.
