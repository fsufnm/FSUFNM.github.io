Shadows are not solely silent and not solely analogue companions. By choosing the projected image out of a plethora of possible aesthetic varieties Georg Friedrich Haas decides on a variant with the pianist foreshadowing them. The electronic means: the played material is recorded live and then repeated---transposed a quarter tone higher---with
an initial delay of 24 seconds to the piano. While the work continues the tempo of the echo playback is increased by the factor 32/33. The sound of the piano itself remains electronically unmodifed. The course of the playback results in most accurately calculated pulsating parallels between the realtime-performance and the playback recording; however due to the time-lapsed playbacks its positions do not allow an exact temporal correspondence. Like the moon penetrating the shadow of the earth, like in a lunar eclipse where the cosmic shadow play reaches a congruent form, here the shadow of the sound follows the performer at increasingly shorter intervals until the permanent diference between the sender of the sound and its transformed echo is set to zero by the end
of the piece. In the delicate sound world of the Austrian composer, in which once again evening and nocturnal atmospheres spin their eerie webs, changes of the tonal and harmonic possibilities of the traditional scale are given a major space through the means of microtonality or experiments with pending overtone constellations. In his "Shadow Play" (**_Ein Schattenspiel_**) he quotes the quartertone music of Ivan Wyschnogradsy and his tempered halving of major sevenths, as well as the music of Richard Heinrich Stein, in which tonal chords are connected by means of voicing in quartertone intervals. In his interpretation Haas has been interested especially in historical aspects of the shadow play: "The musician is constantly confronted with what he has just played. The live electronic is confronting him with his very own history. Finally he will be overtaken by this very history."
