Composing this cycle of songs began with my discovery of three poems in Susan Stewart’s collection Columbarium that I knew I must set to music. The deep, dreamlike wisdom of these poems haunted me, just as I had experienced with Susan’s poem “Cinder” that had served as the fulcrum of my song cycle Holy the Firm. Eventually, texts by Rilke and an earlier setting I had done of a psalm verse were drawn into the gravitational orbit of Susan’s poems. I ordered the texts in a nearly symmetrical pattern, with two texts set a second time in versions that shadow their first readings. This is partly for the sake of the formal design, but, more importantly, to re-examine the poems in the penumbra of what comes before. Rounding the cycle in this way reflects not only the circles and repetitions in Susan Stewart’s texts, but also the way in which, as Rilke writes, the things we have let go of yet encircle us. **_Dark the Star_** was composed for William Sharp and the 21st Century Consort, who gave the premiere, with Christopher Kendall conducting.

Texts

1. Dark the star
Dark the star<br>
deep in the well,<br>
bright in the still<br>
and moving water,<br>
still as the night<br>
circling above<br>
the circle of stone<br>
the darkness surrounds.<br>
Dark the wish<br>
made on the star,<br>
a true wish made<br>
on the water’s image.<br>
<br>
There is no technique in the grass.<br>
There is no technique in the rose.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Susan Stewart

2. Rose
Rose, oh reiner Widerspruch, Lust<br>
Niemandes Schlaf zu sein unter soviel<br>
Lidern<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Rainer Maria Rilke<br>
<br>
Rose, oh pure contradiction, joy<br>
of being No-one’s sleep under so<br>
many lids.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Stephen Mitchell)

3. Shadow/ Shadow
You came upon me like a shadow<br>
and you came into me like a shadow<br>
and there you dwelled within me<br>
and I in you;<br>
we were cast on the black water—<br>
we were cast by the will of the wind<br>
--and drawn across to the darker shore<br>
where no things grow<br>
and the dry leaves gather<br>
and we cannot recognize<br>
the forms of light.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—SS


4. Nights Like These
In solchem Nächten wächst mein Schwesterlein,<br>
das vor mir war und vor mir starb, ganz klein.<br>
Viel solche Nächte waren schon seither:<br>
Sie muß schon schön sein. Bald wird irgendwer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sie frein.<br>					   				
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—RMR<br>					
<br>
Nights like these, my little sister grows,<br>
who was here and died before me, so small.<br>
Many such nights have passed since then.<br>
She must be beautiful by now. Soon someone<br>
will wed her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Edward Snow)


5. From Psalm 116
Pretiosa in conspectu Domini<br>
Mors sanctorum ejus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Psalm 116:15<br>
<br>
Precious in the eyes of God is<br>
the death of his faithful one

6. Rose
Rose, oh reiner Widerspruch, Lust<br>
Niemandes Schlaf zu sein unter soviel<br>
Lidern<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—RMR<br>
<br>
Rose, oh pure contradiction, joy<br>
of being No-one’s sleep under so<br>
many lids.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Stephen Mitchell)


7. Shadow/ Lintel
I stood before the lintel;<br>
the door swung open then.<br>
Your name was there, and mine,<br>
and the date of every birth—<br>
all was clear as day,<br>
but they could not bring me in.<br>
Beyond another door<br>
and then another, endless<br>
more, yet the distance had<br>
been measured in the dust—<br>
one print stepping after<br>
another and none of them<br>
turning back to us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—SS

8. Losing Also is Ours
Auch noch Verlieren ist unser; und selbst das Vergessen<br>
hat noch Gestalt in dem Bleibenden Reich der Verwandlung.<br>
Losgelassenes kreist; und sind wir auch selten die Mitte<br>
einem der Kreise: sie ziehn um uns die heile Figur.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—RMR<br>
<br>
Losing also is ours; and even forgetting<br>
has a shape in the permanent realm of mutation.<br>
Things we’ve let go of circle; and though we are rarely a center<br>
of these circles: they trace around us the unbroken figure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Edward Snow)


9. Dark the star
Dark the star<br>
deep in the well,<br>
bright in the still<br>
and moving water,<br>
still as the night<br>
circling above<br>
the circle of stone<br>
the darkness surrounds.<br>
Dark the wish<br>
made on the star,<br>
a true wish made<br>
on the water’s image.<br>
<br>
There is no technique in the grass.<br>
There is no technique in the rose.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—Susan Stewart
