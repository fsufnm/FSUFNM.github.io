Found in numerous ancient cultures, an ouroboros is a depiction of a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, typically symbolizing eternity or cyclicality. Many of the musical materials in this work are cyclic in nature, with scales or interval patterns that are recursive in some way, exploring suggestions of infinity within a finite space. **_Ouroboros_** was composed in 2017 for the Bold City Contemporary Ensemble.
