**Benjamin Broening**â€™s music couples his interest in the expressive power of sound with a sense of line derived from his background as a singer. A recipient of Guggenheim, Howard and Fulbright Fellowships, Broening has also received recognition and awards from the American Composers Forum, Virginia Commission for the Arts, ACS/Andrew Mellon Foundation, the Jerome Foundation, the Presser Music Foundation, and a teaching award from the University of Richmond. In addition to two solo CDs on the Bridge and Innova labels (recorded by eighth blackbird and duo runedako respectively), his music has also been released by Ensemble U: in Estonia and on the Centaur, Everglade, Equilibrium, MIT Press, Oberlin Music, Open G and SEAMUS record labels. Broening is founder and artistic director of Third Practice, an annual festival of electroacoustic music at the University of Richmond, where he is Professor of Music and Associate Dean of Arts & Sciences.

**_gathering light_** for violin and electronics grew out of a piece I wrote in 2008 for the Estonian sextet Ensemble U:. That piece, changing light, was one of several I have written in the past few years that imperfectly reflect my experience of being in Estonia: *Dark Wood* for cello evokes the feeling of being in the Estonian forests, *Trembling Air* for flute evokes a the quality of energy of the air there filled as it is with the sound of birds, of trees, of water, and *changing light* tries to capture my experience of the magical and changeable quality of Estonian light. *changing light* ends with an extended violin solo, the material and sound world of which seemed to demand further exploration. I revisit my exploration of the liminal light of the Estonian pre-dawn and the material of that violin solo in gathering light.
