**Ladislav Kubík**, eminent Czech-American composer and Professor of Composition at the Florida State University College of Music since 1991, passed away in his sleep on October 27, 2017. Kubík's first orchestral works, composed in his teenage years, received their premieres at the Dvořák Hall at the Rudolphinum in Prague. As a student at the Prague Academy of Music, he received diplomas in composition and music theory in the early 1970s, followed by the "Aspiranture of Arts" in composition in 1980. He was the recipient of many awards and prizes, including first prize in UNESCO’s International Rostrum of Composers Competition, first prize in the International Franz Kafka Composition Competition, first prize in the National Association of College Wind and Percussion Instructors Composition Contest, two Florida Arts Council Individual Artist Fellowships, and (in 2010) a Guggenheim Fellowship.

Prior to his arrival at FSU, Kubík taught at the Prague Conservatory, at Charles University in Prague, at the Université d'Orsay, and at the University of South Florida. In 1994 he established the Czech-American Summer Music Institute in Prague and taught there annually for two decades; in 1995 he founded the Ladislav Kubík International Prize in Composition, supported by Florida State University, which drew entries from around the world. Kubík's own compositions have been performed in nearly thirty countries and have been widely released on commercial recordings. He was a member of the American Composers Forum, the Music Teachers National Association, the Society of Composers Inc., the Association of Czech Musicians and Musicologists, and the Society of Czech Composers. He will be fondly remembered as a gifted composer, a warm and supportive colleague, and a tremendously insightful and encouraging teacher to generations of students.
