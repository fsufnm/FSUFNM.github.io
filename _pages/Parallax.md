**_Parallax_** explores the violin as an object of both sound and performance. Sounds were constructed using my PVCplus audio processing software and individual tone samples taken principally from the violin. Sounds were designed and sequenced so as to present the listener with trajectories of timbre, tuning, and space. As each trajectory advances, the listening experience is reframed or shifted, suggesting, perhaps, a kind of auditory parallax that pits our memory of the instrument against the workâ€™s more skewed forms of it.
