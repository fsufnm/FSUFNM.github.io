A Mighty Fortress (Ein feste Burg) was written by Martin Luther (1483-1546) whose 95 Theses that challenged aspects of the Roman Catholic Church initiated the Protestant Reformation. **_form reform_** was composed for the 500th Anniversary of this reformation and utilizes the first stanza of Luther's melody, heavily altering the rhythm and iterating the contour through chord clusters that are constructed and deconstructed throughout. The stanza also appears in fragments throughout the piece but is never presented as clearly as in its final iteration.
