**_Ruckamuck_** is based upon the text of a poem by Danella Carter which uses extended word play, nonsense syllables, and whimsical double entendre. The musical equivalent features many digital studio techniques, special effects, and all manner of sonic tomfooolery. All the vocalizations were done by Chris Theofanidis. Stylistic influences range from jazz (Danella's music of choice) to hip-hop, Russian men's choir, and beyond.
