_**Imaginary Figure**_ for piano (2018)  
This work freely describes a number of characters, or imaginary figures. Each character is clearly identified by distinct rhythmic and motivic personality. These figures interact in various forms throughout the entire piece: sometimes they seem to argue and contradicts one another, at times they complement each other.  
A wide range of color, resonance, density and technique is displayed through the course of the work.  
The various contradictions among the figures contribute to the richness of sound and vitality of form. These contrasts manifest themselves, among others, in dramatic, forward-moving, low-range passages, versus soft and dreamy fragments which mainly focus upon the very high, ״bell- like” range of the instrument.  
The work is dedicated to David Kalhous with gratitude and friendship.
